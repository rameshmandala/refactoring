/**
 * Tease Apart Inheritance (362) deals with a tangled inheritance hierarchy that
 * seems to combine several variations in a confusing way. Convert Procedural
 * Design to Objects (368) helps solve the classic problem of what to do with
 * procedural code. A lot of programmers use object-oriented languages without
 * really knowing about objects, so this is a refactoring you often have to do.
 * If you see code written with the classic two-tier approach to user interfaces
 * and databases, you’ll find you need Separate Domain from Presentation (370)
 * when you want to isolate business logic from user interface code. Experienced
 * object-oriented developers have learned that this separation is vital to a
 * long-lived and prosperous system. Extract Hierarchy (375) simplifies an
 * overly-complex class by turning it into a group of subclasses.
